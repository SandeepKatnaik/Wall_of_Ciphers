# Wall_of_Ciphers

The "Wall of Ciphers" is a versatile and user-friendly mobile application designed to explore, learn, and apply various types of ciphers for encoding and decoding messages. With an intuitive and engaging interface, the app offers a comprehensive collection of classical and modern ciphers, including the Caesar cipher, Vigen√®re cipher, Playfair cipher, and even more complex cryptographic techniques. Users can input their plaintext message and select their preferred cipher type, key, and encryption settings. The app then seamlessly processes the input and provides the encrypted output, enabling users to securely share coded messages. Additionally, the Ciphers App serves as an educational tool, offering insights into the principles behind each cipher and providing historical context. Whether for fun, educational purposes, or practical use in enhancing message privacy, this app is a valuable resource for both cryptography enthusiasts and those seeking a convenient way to experiment with different ciphers and their applications.
